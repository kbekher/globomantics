# Globomantics Node.js Application


Node.js App with EJS Template Engine, Routing, Security, User Authentication, MongoDB Connection, and API Services

## Overview

This Node.js application serves as a boilerplate for building web applications with features including routing, user authentication, secure connections, MongoDB database integration, and consumption of external API services. It is structured to provide a foundation for building robust web applications with Node.js.

## Features

- EJS Template Engine: Utilizes the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) template engine for server-side rendering of dynamic content.
- Routing: Implements routing using Express.js, allowing for efficient handling of HTTP requests and navigation between different parts of the application.
- Security: Includes security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and others.
- User Authentication: Provides user authentication functionality, enabling users to securely log in, log out, and access protected resources within the application.
- MongoDB Connection: Integrates with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing and retrieving application data. This includes user information, session data, and other relevant data structures.
- API Services: Demonstrates how to interact with external API services, enabling the application to fetch or send data to third-party services.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- MongoDB database instance set up (locally or remote)s.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd nodejs-app-template
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm to install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Define the necessary environment variables such as `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, `SESSION_SECRET`, etc. in package.json nodemonConfig

5. **Start the Application**: Launch the application by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment variables) to access the application.


## Usage

- Navigate through the application using the defined routes.
- Register an account or log in with existing credentials to access authenticated features.
- Explore how data is stored and retrieved from the MongoDB database.
- Experiment with integrating additional API services by modifying the existing codebase.




## Acknowledgements

This application is built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and other open-source technologies as a part of Node.js and Express Course at Pluralsight.
